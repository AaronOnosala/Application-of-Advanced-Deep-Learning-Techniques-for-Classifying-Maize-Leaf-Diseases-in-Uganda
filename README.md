# Maize Classification Project
## Overview
The Maize Disease Classification project aimed to develop a robust model capable of accurately classifying maize leaf images into five categories: healthy, and four distinct disease classes:

1. FAW - Images show leaves that have suffered [fallarmy worm damage.](https://agriculture.go.ug/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/FAW-Brochure_MAAIF_DCP_revised_April_2018.pdf)
2. MLB - Images show leaves affected by [Maize Leaf Blight](https://lfl.bayern.de/ips/blattfruechte/050760/index.php#:~:text=First%20symptoms%20on%20maize%20plants,green%20to%20light%20brown%20lesions.)
3. MLN - Images show leaves affected by [Maize Lethal Necrosis](https://www.cabidigitallibrary.org/doi/10.1079/cabicompendium.119663)
4. MSV - Images show leaves affected by [Maize Streak Virus](https://www.cabidigitallibrary.org/doi/10.1079/cabicompendium.32620)
